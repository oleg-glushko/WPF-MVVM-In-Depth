It's a rewrite of the "[WPF MVVM in Depth](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/wpf-mvvm-in-depth)" course's examples from the .NET Framework 4.7 to the .NET 6. I've had to make some adjustments here and there to make them work correctly. Also, the final project now uses Microsoft's DI instead of Unity.

You're requred to set up a database using the included .sql script before running any of these examples.

Please note that I'm not an expert WPF developer, so here could (and probably would) be suboptimal parts of code. My goal was better understand an MVVM pattern per se, but not a WPF framework.
